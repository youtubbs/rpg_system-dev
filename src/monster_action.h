/**
 * Describes the single step a monster intends to take this tick.
 *
 * Produced by monster::decide_action() — a const, read-only planning function
 * that is safe to call from worker threads.  Consumed by
 * monster::execute_action(), which performs all state mutations.
 *
 * All write operations (move_to, attack_at, bash_at, open_door, die, stumble,
 * special attacks, path trimming, repath, facing, wandf decrement, etc.) live
 * exclusively in execute_action().  decide_action() reads only.
