/**
 * Manages fire-spread load requests for out-of-bubble simulation.
 *
 * When fire on a properly-loaded submap would spread to an adjacent unloaded
 * submap, fire_spread_loader requests that submap via the load manager using
 * the fire_spread source.  This preserves physically correct fire spread
 * behavior at the boundary of the loaded set.
 *
 * A global ceiling of fire_spread_submap_cap (default 25, player-configurable
 * via FIRE_SPREAD_SUBMAP_CAP option) fire-spread-loaded submaps is enforced
 * across all dimensions combined.
 *
 * The connectivity invariant: a fire-spread-loaded submap is released during
 * prune_disconnected() if it is not reachable via cardinal fire-loaded
 * neighbors from a non-fire_spread (properly-loaded) submap.
